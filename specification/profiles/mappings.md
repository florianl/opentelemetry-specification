# Mappings

**Status**: [Development](../document-status.md), except where otherwise specified

This document defines the required attributes of [`Mapping`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/profiles/0239-profiles-data-model.md#message-mapping) messages.

## Attributes

A message representing a `Mapping` MUST have at least one of the following
attributes:

- `process.executable.build_id.gnu`
- `process.executable.build_id.go`
- `process.executable.build_id.profiling`

If possible all the above listed attributes SHOULD be present in a `Mapping`. To promote interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED for `process.executable.build_id.profiling` to be present in every `Mapping`.

### Algorithm for `process.executable.build_id.profiling`

In some environments GNU and/or Go build_id values are stripped or not usable - for example Alpine
Linux which is often used as a base for Docker environments. For that reason and to promote interoperability, a deterministic build_id generation algorithm that hashes the first and last page of a file together with its length is defined as:

TRUNC(SHA256(first4k, last4k, fileLen))

where `TRUNC` returns the first 16bytes of the resulting digest, input to `SHA256` is passed left to right, `first4k`, `last4k` are the first and last 4096 bytes of the file (may overlap) and `fileLen` is the 8byte big-endian serialization of the file length.
